Conventions for contributions to this organization

## Repositories

### Naming

Repositories are named in kebab-case. https://kulturbanause.de/faq/was-ist-kebab-case/

### Access

By default, repositories are private. Public repositories are only created if an organization administrator allows to do so.
For individual access control, there are teams for each year of apprenticeship, aswell es for the individual projects. 

## Code

### Committing

Each coding session only has one push. You should actively commit your changes and push them at the end of your session. Do not write hundrets of lines of code and commit them only once with the message "added feature X"

#### Naming

Commit messages are written only in lower case, also starting with an lower case character.
